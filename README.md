# UDT Plugin

QGIS Plugin that groups in a single interface the most important tools, apps and scripts 
developed by the Territorial Delimitation Unit from the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya during the last few years.
This project was born not only due the migration to a new spatial database such as PostGIS but the deployment of a entire and new 
system developed for the unit. It that situation was mandatory to remake all the old apps and tools in order to adapt to the new environment.
